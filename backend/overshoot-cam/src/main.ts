// This file has been refactored and moved to the React dashboard.
// The Overshoot vision functionality is now integrated into:
// - components/dashboard/useOvershootVision.ts (React hook)
// - app/dashboard/page.tsx (dashboard integration)
//
// The vision analysis now updates the AISummary and WarningWidget components
// in real-time instead of manipulating DOM elements directly.
